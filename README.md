Hi, I'm Marie! 

I am a fourth year **Game Design & Interactive Media** major at the **University of California, Irvine** where I specialize in technical production.

I am also the Production Director of UCIâ€™s Video Game Development Club for the 2025-2026 academic year. I love contributing to video game projects as a producer and aspire to be a producer in the games industry!
